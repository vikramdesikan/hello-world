# hello-world
This is my first repository on Git Hub. Ill be posting my billion $ ideas here ;)
Im a Lead Software Engineer who has been working in Business Intelligence field. About 12 years ago I graduated with a Master's in computer science speecializing in VLSI design. Since my graduation software development has changed drastically, not to mention the advent of mobile programming platforms. This is my attempt to reenter the field of software programming. Hopefully they wont be as tough as wrting Uehara and van Cleemput algorithm in C++.
